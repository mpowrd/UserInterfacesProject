We've been together for a decade now
Still everyday I'm loving you more
If I could do it all again
I'd probably do it all the same as before

I don't wanna know what would have happened if I never had had your love
I didn't become myself before I met you
I don't wanna know what would have happened if I never had felt your love

Everything about you I like
We started out so fast
Now we can take it slower

Love takes some time, takes a little time, so take a little time

As it ages like wine
How does it keep getting better?
Everyday our love finds a new way to grow
The time we spend together
Mmm, simply feels good
We got a good thing going
And just when I thought that my heart was full
I found places that I never explored
You're so fascinating
I can't remember the last time I was bored

I don't wanna know what would have happened if I never had had your love
I didn't become myself before I met you
I don't wanna know what would have happened if I never had felt your love
