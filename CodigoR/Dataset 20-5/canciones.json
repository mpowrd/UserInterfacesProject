Oh…\\nCan't we get an alternate ending?\\nCan't we get an alternate ending? Oh…\\n\\nThis is the ghost of you\\nHaunting the ghost of me\\nWe're lonely in a crowded room together\\nTell me who's scared now\\n\\nThis is the ghost of you\\nHaunting the ghost of me\\nWe're playing house in these walls forever\\nTell me who's scared now\\n\\nThis is the ghost of you (Ah…)\\nHaunting the ghost of me\\nWe're lonely in a crowded room together\\nTell me who's scared now\\n\\nThis is the ghost of you (Tell me who's scared now)\\nHaunting the ghost of me\\nWe're playing house in these walls forever\\nTell me who's scared now",
